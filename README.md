Summary: Research and Implement Amplify Console Logger with CloudWatch Integration in LVAR Application

Description:
To improve logging and monitoring capabilities in the LVAR application, we need to research and implement Amplify's console logger with integration to AWS CloudWatch. This task includes:

Understanding the Amplify logging framework and its integration with AWS CloudWatch.
Configuring Amplify logger to capture logs such as error logs, debug logs, and key application events.
Ensuring logs are sent to AWS CloudWatch for centralized storage, analysis, and monitoring.
Testing the implementation to verify that logs are correctly captured and visible in CloudWatch.
Documenting the configuration and usage for future reference.
